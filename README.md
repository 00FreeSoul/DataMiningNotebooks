# DataMiningNotebooks

Please see the following data mining example notebooks that go along with my Data Mining companion class at Southern Methodist University.  

Notebooks are numbered by the unit (i.e., week) at which they ovvur in the class. Other class examples are prefixed with "E" and then the number of the example. Also included here are some of the test notebooks for various in-class assignments we use throughout the semester.
